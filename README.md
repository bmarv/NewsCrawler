# NewsCrawler

Webcrawler, that scrapes the websites of [FAZ](https://www.faz.net/faz-live) and [WELT](https://www.welt.de/newsticker/) for the live-ticker. 
The found data will be saved in a JSON-file and ordered regarding the publication time, title and link. 

This crawler uses the npm package [selenium-webdriver](https://www.npmjs.com/package/selenium-webdriver).

The development of this project was purely independent.
